# Other projects - Physics-based Modelling
During my graduate studies, I developed several models and frameworks for physics-based modeling, including invariant-based methods, variational methods, finite element methods (FEM), and empirical approaches. I implemented these models in commercial software using Python scripts and Fortran subroutines. Much of this work has been presented at top conferences and published in leading journals. Some of my publications related to these physics-based models can be found here:
